# Notes

- Merged ItemByUnit and ItemByWeight into Item. Made more sense as in the end we get the price
by multiplying the price of an arbitrary unit by a quantity. Introduced unit enum to differentiate later on behaviour to tackle the 1kg of vegetables case.
- Deleted ProductTest as it only contained one test on what the price of an item.
- Renamed WeighedProductTest to ItemTest since it actually tests the expected values from items.
- Added Lombok to avoid repeating boilerplate code.
- Removed legacy Junit to use the latest tools available and for removing a no longer needed library. 
Also upgraded jupiter to a more recent version.
- Introduced `Product.name` to use as label for offer matching.
- Introduced OfferService to provide an interface for calculating deduction based on the offers.
- Fixed bug on the buy one, get one free scenario where if there is 3 items, it would return deduction on 1.5 items rather than 1.
- Introduced `FixedPriceOffer` to support the two items for Â£1 offer scenario
- ProductUnit introduced to potentially handle the 1kg of vegetables scenario
